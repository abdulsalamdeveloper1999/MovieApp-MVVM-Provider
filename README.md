# Flutter MVVM Movie App


## About

This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing a Flutter app that follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. The app focuses on displaying movie information, including movie posters, titles, languages, release dates, and overviews. It serves as a demonstration of my skills in building user-friendly mobile applications with efficient data management and presentation using the MVVM design pattern.
